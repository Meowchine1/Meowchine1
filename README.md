## 🧭 About Me

I’m an  engineer and developer with a strong background in:

- **C/C++**, **Python**
- **Embedded development** (ESP32, STM32)
- **Automatic control systems** for **UAVs**
- **Mathematical modeling**
- **Git**, **ROS**, **Linux-based development**

My current focus is on designing and implementing **control systems for drones**,  
with a special emphasis on **high-speed navigation**, trajectory tracking, and dynamic motion control.

I enjoy working at the intersection of software, physics, and real-world constraints — building systems that not only move, but move smartly.

## 🚀 What I’m Looking For

I’m open to:
- **Embedded & UAV-related projects**
- **Interdisciplinary collaborations** where I can apply engineering thinking
- Roles in **technical coordination**, **project leadership**, or **STEM education**

Looking for opportunities where I can combine **scientific potential** with **real-world impact**, especially in projects where precision, speed, and autonomy matter.
